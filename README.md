"# ML-Projects" 

This is going to be where I post my ML projects

My plan is to do:

Supervised
- Univariate Linear Regression
- Multivariate Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- SVM

Unsupervised
- PCA
- Anomaly Detection
- k Means Clustering
- Recommender System

I will do the majority of the models using scikit-learn, then neural 
networks using PyTorch and TensorFlow.
This will compliment the theory learned in Andrew Ng's Machine Learning 
Coursera course.
