"# ML-Projects" 

This is going to be where I post my ML projects

My plan is to do:

Supervised
- Univariate Linear Regression
- Multivariate Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- Neural Networks

Unsupervised
- PCA
- Anomaly Detection
- k Means Clustering
- Recommender System

All in Python with a few different libraries (PyTorch, scikit-learn etc.).
This will compliment the theory learned in Andrew Ng's Machine Learning 
Coursera course.
